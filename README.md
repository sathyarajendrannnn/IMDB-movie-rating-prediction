# IMDB Movie Rating Prediction

Overview
The IMDB Movie Rating Prediction project aims to predict the ratings of movies based on various features such as name, year, duration, genre, rating, votes, director, and main actors. By utilizing machine learning techniques on the IMDB dataset, this project seeks to build predictive models that estimate the likelihood of a movie's rating, providing insights into the factors that contribute to a film's success.

Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the IMDB dataset and develop a model that accurately predicts movie ratings. By understanding the elements that influence ratings, we can gain valuable insights into audience preferences and the characteristics of successful films.

Features
The dataset includes the following key features for each movie:
  Name: Title of the movie
  Year: Year the movie was released
  Duration: Total runtime of the movie (in minutes)
  Genre: Genre(s) of the movie
  Rating: Average rating of the movie on IMDB
  Votes: Total number of votes received
  Director: Name of the movie's director
  Actor 1: Main actor in the movie
  Actor 2: Supporting actor in the movie
  Actor 3: Additional supporting actor in the movie

Methodology
Data Preprocessing
- Load the dataset and handle missing values.
- Convert categorical variables (like genre and director) into numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding.
- Normalize or standardize numerical features if necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize the data to understand the distribution of features and their relationships with ratings.
- Identify patterns and correlations that may influence movie ratings.

Model Building
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Implement various machine learning algorithms, including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

Model Evaluation
- Compare the performance of different models to identify the best-performing one.
- Use cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.

Prediction
- Use the trained model to predict ratings for new movie data.

Conclusion
This project serves as a practical application of machine learning techniques while providing valuable insights into the factors that influence movie ratings. By analyzing historical data, we can better understand audience preferences and the dynamics of film success in the entertainment industry.
